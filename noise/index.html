Welcome
=======

<div class="alert alert-success">**Welcome! First of all we want to thank you for purchasing our Noise WordPress Theme.**</div>

In the following sections we will explain how to set up and use Noise theme the easiest way possible. Although there're a lot of things written in this documentation, the theme itself is not hard to use. You can go to the Theme Options page and explore everything yourself. This file is more of a reference if you do not know what to do, or if you are not familiar with WordPress.

If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this help file, please feel free to ask your questions at the [support forum](http://fitwp.com/envato-support/).

Best regards

Theme Information
=================

Files Included
==============

The download package (`.zip`) that you get from ThemeForest contains the following files and folder:

- `noise.zip`: main theme file that need to be uploaded to host to install Noise theme
- `demo-content.xml`: demo content file, which contains all pages and posts from live preview website. It will help you to have a first look of how we use Noise theme
- `docs.html`: theme documentation (this file)




Installation
============


Install theme
-------------

After you download the `.zip` package from ThemeForest, unzip it. You'll see a file `noise.zip`, which is the main file that needed to upload and install.

You can either choose to upload and installl the theme using **FTP** or use **WordPress theme install** function.

**Upload and install using FTP**

- Unzip `noise.zip`, you'll get a folder `noise`
- Use a FTP client like [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/) and upload that folder to `wp-content/themes` folder on your host
- Go to `Appearance > Themes` and activate **Noise** theme

**Install theme using WordPress install function**

- Go to `Appearance > Themes` and click **Add New**
- Select **Upload**
- Click **Browse** and select the `noise.zip` file
- Click **Install Now**
- When upload and installation progresses are completed, click **Activate**, or go to `Appearance > Themes` and activate **Noise** theme

![upload](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/whisper/wordpress-upload.png)




Install plugins
---------------

After installing Noise, you'll see a notification in the top of the page that says the theme needs some plugins to function properly.

Noise theme **requires** the [Meta Box](http://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/) plugin (free and available on WordPress.org) and **recommends** [MailPoet Newsletters (formerly Wysija)](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wysija-newsletters/) (free and available on WordPress.org).

Noise is working perfectly with these plugins. It automatically adds more styles to them to make the design match the theme.

To install these plugins:

- Click **Begin installing plugins**
- You'll be redirect to a page where all needed plugins are listed. Just click on **Install** below each plugin's name
- After installing, if it's required to activate the plugin, just activate

![plugins](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/noise/install-plugins.png)




Install demo content
--------------------

If you are new to WordPress and have problems with setting up the theme you might want to import the demo content file that comes with the theme. The following actions will import some dummy posts and pages from the live preview:

- Go to `Tools > Import`
- Select **WordPress** from the list
- If you haven't installed the **WordPress import plugin**, a popup window will appears and ask you to install it. Just click **Install Now**. When the installation progress is completed, click **Activate Plugin & Run Importer**. If you have installed this plugin, skip to next step.
- Click **Browse** and select `demo-content.xml` file from the download package
- Click **Upload file and import**
- When you are asked to import author, you can create new author or import to existing author. You also should check the checkbox **Download and import file attachments**.

![import](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/whisper/import.png)

After completing all above steps, go to `Track`, `Artist`, `Album` to see imported data.




Setup menu
----------

Because we haven't created a menu for primary location, the theme will display WordPress pages by default, which is not correct.

Following these steps to assign a menu:

- Go to `Appearance > Menus`
- Select an existing to edit, or click **create a new menu**. **Note:** when you import theme data, WordPress automatically create a menu **Main** for you, so select it if you want to have same menu as in live preview.
- Select items in **Noise Sections** from the left meta box and click **Add to Menu**.
- On the right, feel free to drag and drop menu items to organize them.
- When you're done moving menu items, check **Primary Menu** for **theme locations** at the bottom of the page
- Click **Save Menu**

![menu](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/noise/menu.png)

<div class="alert">**Note 1:** This changes only order of menu items, not order of sections. To change order of sections, please go to Theme Options.</div>

<div class="alert">**Note 2:** If you use the imported menu (e.g. the **Main** menu which is automatically created), you have to **change the URL** of menu item. Currently they're pointed to section of demo website, and you have to change URL to your website.</div>

![menu](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/noise/menu-link.png)



Setup widget areas
------------------

Noise theme has only 1 widget area (sidebar) for **Blog** page. By default, Noise works perfectly with all widgets, so you just need to drag and drop widgets from the left to the sidebar area. That's all.

![sidebar](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/whisper/sidebar.png)

To see options for each widgets, please read the **Widgets** section.

That's all! Now you have the website up with all *basic* elements!




Theme Options
=============

TODO: Change image

![theme options](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/whisper/theme-options.png)

The Noise theme comes with unique, creative and easy-to-use Theme Options page. You can change all theme options in one place!

With Noise's advanced theme options panel, you can customize just about any part of your site quickly and easily. You can change options for each section on the site. Upload your own custom favicon, input custom CSS. Change title, subtitle for each section. Upload background for parallax effect, etc.

All options have full description so you can know what you are doing. Just click and save!

Let's go through each section.




General
-------


![general](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/noise/general.png)

This sections contains:

- **(1)**: autoplay, allow the player auto plays music when website is loaded
- **(2)**: favicon upload, allows you to upload favicon for you website
- **(3)**: touch icon, allows you to upload icon for mobile devices and tablets

After changing favicon and touch icon, click **Save Changes**.



### Favicon Upload

[Favicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) (short for Favorite icon), also known as a shortcut icon, Web site icon, tab icon or bookmark icon, is a file containing one or more small icons, most commonly 16x16 pixels, associated with a particular Web site or Web page. Browsers that provide favicon support typically display a page's favicon in the browser's address bar (sometimes in the history as well) and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks. Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically show a page's favicon next to the page's title on the tab, and site-specific browsers use the favicon as a desktop icon.

This is how favicon appears:

![favicon](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Wikipedia_favicon_in_Firefox_on_KDE.png/250px-Wikipedia_favicon_in_Firefox_on_KDE.png)

Noise lets you upload favicon or enter favicon URL in the input box:

- If you have a favicon uploaded, or you store the favicon somewhere out of the Media Library, you can just **put the URL of the favicon into the input box**, or
- If you want to upload favicon for your website, **click the upload button** (the green one near input box) and upload it to Media Library as a normal image, then click **Select**.

<div class="alert">The favicon should be in one of the following format: `.ico`, `.png`, `.gif`. Usually we should use `.ico`.</div>

When you're done, you can click **Save Changes** button to save your data.



### Touch Icon

Touch icons are the favicons of mobile devices and tablets. Each mobile devices and tablets has its own standards for displaying the touch icon (read [this article](http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/touch-icons) to have a better understanding about touch icon and supported devices) and requires various icon sizes. But for best compatibility and simplicity, an **image with size 152x152 is enough**.

To specify a touch icon for you website, just do the same as for favicon: you can either put the URL of the touch icon into the input box or upload the icon to Media Library.

<div class="alert">The icon must be an PNG image</div>

When you're done, you can click **Save Changes** button to save your data.




Design
------

This sections contains:

- **Background**: allows you to select background pattern or image, and change how it appear
- **Custom CSS**: allows you to add your custom CSS




### Background

This section help you to select background pattern or image, and change how it appear.

**(6)**: background attachment, can be `Scroll` (will scroll when you scroll the content) or `Fixed` (will stay fixed when you scroll the content)

<div class="alert alert-success">**Tips**: A lot of background patterns can be found at [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com/).</div>

After done, click **Save Changes** button to save your data. Now go to the frontend and check the background.

<div class="alert alert-info">The options 3-6 are similar to CSS properties for background and a little technical. If you don't understand what they mean, just change the values, save and preview changes!</div>




### Custom CSS

![custom css](http://fitwp.github.io/docs/noise/custom-css.png)

This section allows to enter custom CSS that will be output in the `</head>`. This will **overwrite** CSS of theme, so please be careful!
